This extension provides various helper commands.

## Provided Features

-   **Hediet Power Tools: Apply Rename** (bound to F2). Renames identifiers after you already changed them.

    This is incredible useful if combined with other multi cursor features. Should work for every language that has rename and word highlighting capabilities.

## Planned Commands (Not Implemented Yet)

-   Extend all selections until a selected character is found (inspired by `yo1dog.multi-cursor-search`).
-   Replace all selections with the result of a javascript function (inspired by `map-replace.js`).
